## 👩‍💻 About the project

Site for buying coffees, where you go through the phase of adding the product to the cart, choosing the address and confirming the order!

Project built during [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) ReactJS course, where I was able to deepen my knowledge of this front-end library
